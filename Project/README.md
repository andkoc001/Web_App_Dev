## Background

This is my assignment project to Web Application Development module, Galway-Mayo Institute of Technology, 2020.

This GitHub repository documents my initial research, project progress (via git version control) and the final project outcome. As it is also a learning exercise for me, I have made attempt to comment various functionalities also for my future reference.

## Assignment objectives

The assignment concerns the creation of a business website that employs the principles of HTML5, CSS and JavaScript with a special emphasis on data visualisation using D3 functionality.

The primary requirements are as follows:

* Have a minimum of 3 linked pages;  
* Allow the customer to enter their login details and have login details validated (via a login screen);  
* Perform form validation through JavaScript or HTML to ensure that:  
  + text fields are not empty;  
  + a valid email address is entered.  
* Access and change HTML on the web page through the DOM;  
* Access and change styling through the DOM;  
* Demonstrate the use of events;  
* Contain 2 data visualisations (e.g., Bar Chart) of your choosing  
  + One from a CSV file  
  + One from an array  
* Both visualisations should allow the user to specify display settings, including an option to change colour, display size and animations.

The detailed instructions can be found in the assignment description ([pdf](https://learnonline.gmit.ie/pluginfile.php/203864/mod_resource/content/1/Higher%20Diploma%20in%20Science%20in%20Data%20Analytics.pdf)).

This project is intended to further familiarisation with data analytics. It is also intended to get familiar with the modern web  tools, specifically the JavaScript library - Data Driven Document (D3). The project will allow to get practical understanding and experience with data visualisation in web environment
